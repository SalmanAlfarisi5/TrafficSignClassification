# Dataset Description
- Consists of around 5000 images containing 23 different traffic signs
- Multi-class classification dataset: 23 classes where each class contains image samples ranging from 100 to over 500
- Each image is RGB image
- The image sizes (height and width) are different for different images
- Image names are formatted as "{Class_Label}_{Sample_Index}.png"
    - Example: "20_17.png" means image no. 17 belonging to class label 20

# Task Expectation
- Need to divide the data evenly for all classes between train and test set
- Usage of different pretraining schemes in case of using CNN models
- Innovative use of training and feature extraction techniques
- Need to effectively handle different size images
- Need to find out which samples are being mistaken by the models and try to resolve the issue

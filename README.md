# Traffic Sign Classification (Multi-Class CNN Benchmark)

This project focuses on classifying 23 types of traffic signs using various CNN architectures. The dataset consists of ~5000 RGB images with varying resolutions and imbalanced class distributions. The goal is to compare different model performances including pretrained and scratch-built CNNs.

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset Overview

- **Total classes**: 23 traffic sign categories  
- **Samples per class**: Ranges from 100 to 500  
- **Image size**: Varies; all images resized to 224Ã—224 during preprocessing  
- **Image format**: RGB `.png` files named as `{Class_Label}_{Sample_Index}.png`

## ðŸ“Œ Task Objectives

- Stratified split: 80% train / 20% test per class  
- Handle variable image sizes with resizing  
- Train a CNN from scratch  
- Benchmark with pretrained models (AlexNet, ResNet50, VGG16, EfficientNetB0)  
- Apply fine-tuning by unfreezing final layers  
- Report train, validation, and test performance
